# Flow DeFi Protocol Architecture

## Three Structural Advantages

### 1. MEV-Free EVM
Flow's consensus architecture separates transaction ordering from execution. Validators cannot reorder transactions to extract MEV (no front-running, no sandwich attacks) on the EVM side.

**DeFi implication:** LP positions retain significantly more fee yield vs Ethereum/Base where MEV bots extract 5–15% of AMM fees. This is a structural LP yield premium for Flow DEXes.

### 2. Cross-VM Atomic Transactions
A single Cadence transaction can call both Cadence contracts and EVM contracts atomically. Either everything executes or nothing does — with no bridge required.

```cadence
// Single transaction: Cadence logic + EVM call — atomic
transaction() {
    prepare(signer: auth(BorrowValue) &Account) {
        let coa = signer.storage.borrow<auth(EVM.Call) &EVM.CadenceOwnedAccount>(
            from: /storage/evm
        ) ?? panic("No CadenceOwnedAccount at /storage/evm for \(signer.address)")

        // Call an EVM contract atomically within this Cadence transaction
        // evmContractAddress is an EVM.EVMAddress (e.g., obtained from a stored address or COA)
        let result = coa.call(
            to: evmContractAddress,
            data: calldata,
            gasLimit: 200000,
            value: EVM.Balance(attoflow: UInt(0))
        )
    }
}
```

**Supported since:** Crescendo upgrade (September 2024)

### 3. SPoCKs (Specialized Proofs of Confidential Knowledge)
SPoCKs are a consensus-layer cryptographic mechanism used by Flow execution nodes to prove they correctly executed a chunk of transactions without revealing the full computation. This is an internal node-protocol primitive — **not accessible to DeFi application developers** and not relevant to Cadence contract or transaction logic.

> **Note:** Privacy-preserving DeFi features (hidden order books, sealed auctions) are not natively enabled by SPoCKs. They require application-layer design patterns.

## COA Pattern (Cadence Owned Accounts)

COAs bridge Cadence and EVM within a single Flow address. One Flow account controls both a Cadence storage space and an EVM address.

### Creating a COA
```cadence
transaction() {
    prepare(signer: auth(SaveValue, IssueStorageCapabilityController, PublishCapability) &Account) {
        // Create COA (one-time per account)
        if signer.storage.borrow<&EVM.CadenceOwnedAccount>(from: /storage/evm) == nil {
            let coa <- EVM.createCadenceOwnedAccount()
            signer.storage.save(<-coa, to: /storage/evm)
            let cap = signer.capabilities.storage.issue<&EVM.CadenceOwnedAccount>(/storage/evm)
            signer.capabilities.publish(cap, at: /public/evm)
        }
    }
}
```

### Using COA for EVM Calls
```cadence
// Borrow COA with call permission
let coa = signer.storage.borrow<auth(EVM.Call) &EVM.CadenceOwnedAccount>(
    from: /storage/evm
) ?? panic("No CadenceOwnedAccount at /storage/evm for \(signer.address)")

// Encode EVM calldata (ABI encoding)
let calldata: [UInt8] = /* ABI-encoded function call */

// Call EVM contract
let result = coa.call(
    to: evmContractAddress,
    data: calldata,
    gasLimit: 100000,
    value: EVM.Balance(attoflow: UInt(0))
)
```

### COA Architecture Use Cases
| Pattern | How |
|---------|-----|
| Cadence NFT + EVM royalties | COA holds EVM revenue, Cadence logic distributes |
| Hybrid DEX | Cadence order book + EVM AMM liquidity pools |
| Cross-chain bridge endpoint | Cadence validates, COA executes EVM mint/burn |
| Protocol-owned EVM liquidity | Cadence governance controls EVM LP positions |

## On-Chain Automation (FlowTransactionScheduler)

`FlowTransactionScheduler` is a native protocol mechanism for scheduling recurring Cadence transactions without off-chain keeper infrastructure.

### Key Properties
- Transactions execute automatically at specified intervals or block heights
- No external trigger required (unlike Keeper networks on EVM)
- Fees deducted from the scheduling account's balance

### Use Cases for DeFi
- Automated rebalancing (AutoBalancer pattern)
- Interest accrual updates (lending protocols)
- Epoch transitions (staking/vesting contracts)
- Reward distribution (no cron bots)

### Deployment
`FlowTransactionScheduler` shipped as part of the Forte network upgrade (October 22, 2025) and is deployed to the service account on mainnet, testnet, and emulator. Scheduling is done via Cadence transactions to that contract. The `flow schedule` CLI command group (`flow schedule setup`, `flow schedule list`, `flow schedule get`, `flow schedule cancel`) wraps these Cadence transactions as a convenience.

## VRF Randomness

Flow provides on-chain verifiable random numbers via the `RandomBeaconHistory` contract — no oracle required.

```cadence
import "RandomBeaconHistory"

access(all) fun getRandomSeed(blockHeight: UInt64): [UInt8] {
    return RandomBeaconHistory.sourceOfRandomness(atBlockHeight: blockHeight).value
}
```

**DeFi applications:** Fair lottery/raffle contracts, randomized NFT drops, prediction market resolution.
